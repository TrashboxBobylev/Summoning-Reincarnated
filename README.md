Summoning Pixel Dungeon: Reincarnated (or Summoning: Reincarnated for short) is an open-source traditional roguelike dungeon crawler with randomized levels, enemies and allies, and hundreds of items to collect and use. It's a remake and re-evaluation of older [Summoning Pixel Dungeon](https://github.com/TrashboxBobylev/summoning-pixel-dungeon) and is based on the [source code of Shattered Pixel Dungeon](https://github.com/00-Evan/shattered-pixel-dungeon), by [00-Evan/Shattered Pixel](https://shatteredpixel.com).

Summoning: Reincarnated currently compiles for Android and Desktop platforms. You can find official releases of the game on:

[![Github Releases](https://shatteredpixel.com/assets/images/badges/github.png)](https://github.com/TrashboxBobylev/Summoning-Reincarnated/releases/)

Note that Summoning: Reincarnated is _rolling release_ project, being compiled automatically with each push.

There is no official blog or donation page, because I am unable to create and support both.

The game also has a translation project hosted on [Transifex](https://www.transifex.com/trashboxbobylev/summoning-reincarnated/).
